#Summary
_anime_ is a free sprite animation library for use with the LÃ–VE game engine. It
was designed to be better than any other animation library, and it's main 
concerns are speed, ease of use, flexibility, simplicity, and features.

#Release Status
The current version is 0.1.1 and is considered **unstable**. More features are
on the way, and bug testing needs to be done.

#How you can help
- Use _anime_ and report any bugs.
- Request features. If it could be useful to you, it could probably be useful to 
someone else too.
- Submit bug fixes or new features.

#License
All of _anime_'s code is released under the MIT license. 

No credit is needed for using the library, but a mention in your credits 
wouldn't hurt, now would it? Either way, if you could at least shoot me an email 
and tell me what your using it for, that'd be nice: *thecodingotaku AT live DOT
